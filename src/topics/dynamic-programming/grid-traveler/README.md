Say that you are a traveller on a 2D grid. You begin in the top-left corner and your goad is to travel to the bottom-right corner. You may only move down or right.

In how many ways can you travel to the goal on a grid with dimensions m * n?

Write a function girdTraveler(m, n) that calculates this.
