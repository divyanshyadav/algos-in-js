# Shortest Directed Cycle

Given a digraph G, design an efficient algorithm to find a directed cycle with the minimum number of edges (or report that the graph is acyclic). The running time of your algorithm should be at most proportional to V(E + V) and use space proportional to E + V, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
