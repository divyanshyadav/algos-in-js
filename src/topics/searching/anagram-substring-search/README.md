Given string A has length of million characters and string B has length of 256 and characters of string B are non-repetitive, find out if the substring B is present in any kind of order in string A, but it has to be consecutive.

For eg:
A = 'awesomethingsarethereintheworld'
B = 'lord';

At the end of the A string we can see 'orld' which can be a form of string B ‘lord’
